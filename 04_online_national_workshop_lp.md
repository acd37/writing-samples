# Workshop Lesson Plan: Big-O Notation #1

## Overview

This is the first in a series of three on Big O Notation. While Big O Notation is not something that developers will work on directly every day in industry, it is a) a commonly used interview topic and b) an important concept for developers to understand and consider in their application development.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

- Explain what Big O Notation is and why it is important to understand.
- Use Big O Notation concepts to refactor and revise code to make it more efficient.
- Describe the typical scenarios where Big O Notation concepts may be readily helpful in the workplace.

### Workshop-At-A-Glance

This workshop will introduce students to Big O Notation at a high level, and then ask the students to complete a coding challenge in order to reinforce the concept.

After a short review, students will have the opportunity to refactor their code with Big O Notation concepts in mind.

### Preparing For Your Workshop

To best prepare for this workshop, ensure that you:

- Have reviewed and understand the concepts of Big O Notation

- Review and prepare to present the slidedeck, paying attention to potential questions that might come up from students during the presentation part of the workshop.

- Review E-1 and C-1 coding challenges for Big O Notation.

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome & Introduction (5 min)

Instructor introduces themself and their co-host on the call, and reminds students to stay on mute when not answering a question.

Ask students to check in via Splash link.

Introduce the topic as Big O Notation and review the learning objectives with the workshop attendees.

### 2. Everybody Do: Q&A Discussion (5 min)

The goal of this section is to calm students who may be nervous about being on a video conference, and also to create some sense of community among strangers on the call.

Take the time to feel out the level and engagement of the attendees. Ask the room if there are any questions about the workshop, the format, its topic, or about Big O Notation itself that they would like answers to.

As you’re getting questions, use your discretion on which ones to answer immediately (if they have relatively simple answers) versus those that might require a longer discussion. For those that can’t be immediately answered, or will be covered in the slide deck presentation, make a note of those and let the students know.

> Tip: If students don’t have any questions, ask someone to give their own definition of Big O Notation or call on somebody to offer their insight.

### 3. Instructor Do: Present Slidedeck (15 min)

Big O Notation is difficult. Some students will never have heard of it, most will still not really understand it even if they have heard of it.

Take the full amount of allocated time to work through the deck at a steady pace, while maintaining clarity in the presentation.

Remind students that it’s okay if they don’t fully understand it, and that after the presentation, we’ll be doing some hands on activities that will help.

### 4. Instructor Do: Introduce Coding Challenge (5 min)

Open up your browser to the coding challenges for this workshop as described above.

Explain that there are two different challenges they can try, but whichever one they pick, they should stick with it throughout the workshop.

E-1 is the easier activity of the two. C-1 is the “challenge” activity.

Students should feel comfortable tackling which ever activity matches their experience level in the program.

Remember, you could have anybody from Week 3 FSF students to graduates of the program on the call, so we try to keep activity options open!

### 5. Student Do: Pseudocode E-1 / C-1 (5 min)

The goal of this section is to give students non-coding time to consider how they might solve the solution.

Ask the students to read the instructions for the activity they have selected from the `*_unsolved.js` file.

Each student should use VS Code to write out the pseudocode steps for how they would approach this algorithm. Remind students that pseudocoding is a highly important skill for technical interviewing.

### 6. Instructor Do: Review Pseudocode (5 min)

Ask the students on the call if anybody is willing to share their pseudocode. Usually, two or three students are willing to share. You can have them paste it into the chat for everybody to see.

Thank the students for sharing, read through their pseudocode and commend the students for what they did well. Offer up some constructive feedback on ways the pseudocode might be improved.

### 7. Students Do: Code E-1 / C-1 (10 min)

The goal of this section is to give students coding time to actually tackling the problem. Remind students that it isn’t necessarily about their solution but their process, though it is great if they get a working algorithm.

Ask the students to re-read the instructions for the activity they have selected from the `*_unsolved.js` file and to fill in the code in the missing spots.

### 8. Instructor Do: Review Code (5 min)

Again, ask the students on the call if anybody is willing to share their code. You can have them paste it into the chat for everybody to see.

Thank the students for sharing, read through their code and commend the students for what they did well.

Now you can show the students the `*_solved.js` file and ask them if they have any questions. Explain that as developers, we are always striving to be better and to improve our code. We call this “refactoring”.

### 9. Student Do: Refactor Code E-1 / C-1 (10 min)

The goal of this section is to give students coding time to refactor their code using the principles of Big O Notation that they were presented earlier in the workshops.

Ask the students to refactor their code as well as they can to get a more efficient solution.

### 10. End Workshop(5 min)

Time permitting, show the students the `*_optimized.js` solution, and remind them they can access the coding repository at any time to review the solution.

Reflect on the workshop and congratulate the students on completing it. Explain what other workshops are coming up and how students might sign up for them. What do the students need to know about the next class, unit, etc.?

### 11. Satisfaction Survey
